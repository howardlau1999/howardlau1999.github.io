I am currently a master student at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University in China. I received my B.Eng from the same university.

My research interests broadly lie in distributed system, operating system and file system. I am obsessed with building large-scale efficient system softwares, incorporating modern software engineering techniques and technologies to solve real-world problems. In particular, I am enthusiatic about the development of datacenter-scale software that is scalable, fault-tolerant, and maintainable.

I enjoy working with open-source community. Checkout my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/howardlau1999/) for open-source projects I have contributed to!
