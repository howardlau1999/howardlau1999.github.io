I am currently a Master student at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University in China. I received my B.Eng from the same university.

My research interests broadly lie in distributed system, operating system and file system. I am obsessed with building large-scale efficient system software, incorporating modern software engineering techniques as well as cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. In particular, I am enthusiatic about the development of datacenter-scale software that is robust, scalable, fault-tolerant and manageable. I have also gained some industry experience during my interships at [WeChat, Tencent](https://weixin.qq.com) and [PingCAP](https://pingcap.com).

Having learnt a lot from the open-source community, I am devoted to passing on the merits to others by constantly contributing to open-source projects. Checkout my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/howardlau1999/) for open-source projects I have contributed to!
